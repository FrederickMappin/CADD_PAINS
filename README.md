Welcome to the PAINS Detector repository! This script helps identify Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS) in small molecule libraries. PAINS are compounds that tend to show false positives in screening assays due to non-specific interactions, which can hinder drug discovery. By using this script, researchers can quickly filter out potential PAINS, ensuring that only promising, specific compounds move forward in the drug development process.
